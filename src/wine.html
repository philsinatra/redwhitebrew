              </div>
              <p>The fresh, balanced taste of Clean Slate Riesling is achieved by carefully selecting grapes from vineyards throughout the Mosel. The steep blue slate slopes of the Lower Mosel give the wine its minerality while the Middle Mosel provides a hint of spice to complement the characteristic fresh peach flavors of the Upper Mosel. The flavors are of ripe peach, balanced ripe acidity, hints of lime and characteristic mineral notes. This wine is so versatile ~ it pairs beautifully with spicy cuisines, Asian, Tex-Mex, Indian, and Sushi</p>

              <p>Pairs well with light starters, delicate dishes such as tagliolini with shrimps or seafood risotto and many fish dishes</p>

                <img src="media/wine.jpg" height="433" width="650" alt="Featured Wine">
              </div>
              <p>Whispering Angel comes from the Provence region of France - one of THE premier regions of the world for Rosé. As a negotiant and winery, Caves D'Esclans identifies vineyards, grapes and wines from Château D'Esclans as well as local growers to make what has reputedly become the world's greatest rosé. Their objective is to obtain the best quality grapes, so they have created relationships with the local grape growers whose vineyards are treated with the same high standards of quality as are the vineyards of Château D'Esclans.</p>
              <p>The color is of pale roses, with a fragrance of clean, fresh light summer fruits. The palate retains a certain fleshiness and structure that shows the red grapes base, quite firm texture and fine dry finish.</p>
              <p>Rose is refreshing and quite pleasing, and goes with a variety of foods. It is the PERFECT wine for Spring. It's born to be enjoyed outdoors - drink it by itself or with picnic foods like fruit, all types of salads, shrimp, and mild cheeses such as brie, gouda, or goat cheese. Share Whispering Angel with your friends and family this Easter - it goes perfectly with ham, turkey or any element of your holiday dinner.</p>
